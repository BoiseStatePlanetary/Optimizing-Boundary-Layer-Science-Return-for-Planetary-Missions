\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{Future Directions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run this on entire M2020 MEDA dataset as the foundation for a future science study
    \item Test generalization on Insight pressure sensor data
    \item dust devil detection to abort drone flights (e.g., for Ingenuity)
    \item Field testing
    \item Test other event detection methods including analyses in frequency space (e.g., based on Fourier or wavelet-based approaches)
    \item Incorporation into Distributed Instruments (cite Blue Sky study by Federico Rossi)
\end{itemize}
